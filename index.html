    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>Extended Reality (XR) is a comprehensive term that includes Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR). 
            XR bridges physical and digital worlds, creating interactive, immersive experiences that merge with the real world. It offers 
            numerous applications across education, training, manufacturing, collaborative 3D design, art, and multiplayer gaming.</p>
        <p>Despite these benefits, XR systems introduce unique security, privacy, and trust challenges due to the intimate connection 
            between users,  their XR devices, and their immediate environments. The potential attacks can involve information flooding 
            to induce latency and physical discomfort, injecting misleading virtual content to distract or deceive users, subverting personal 
            area networks to create confusion, spoofing alarms, assessing user status through eye tracking, and accessing onboard cameras 
            to gather environmental information without the user's awareness. Additionally, XR apps can access sensitive real-time inputs 
            like eye gaze, head movement, hand gestures, and even biosignals, and users' immediate environment. These signals, while 
            critical for immersive experiences, open up novel attack surfaces such as keystroke inference, emotional profiling, and 
            behavioral tracking.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Keynote: Intrinsic Cognitive Security</h3>

<p>DARPA’s Intrinsic Cognitive Security (ICS) program is using mathematical approaches, known as formal methods, to guarantee that mixed reality (MR) system designs mitigate potential cognitive effects.  MR merges real and virtual worlds in real time.  Cognitive effects that have been demonstrated in virtual settings include manipulating emotion, inducing cybersickness, causing confusion or anxiety, and reducing trust in equipment.  Cognitive engineering principles are applied to commercial MR systems designs, but today’s methods do not ensure that systems operate safely when facing an adversary intent on interfering with a mission.
</p>
    
<p>This talk describes challenges faced by MR system developers and highlights ICS research progress.

<h3>Privacy Issues in Extended Reality Systems: Past, Present, and Future</h3>

<p>Extended Reality (XR) technology has become integral to critical sectors such as healthcare, military, and education. Despite its benefits, XR devices necessitate the continuous collection of vast personal data streams—including body movements, eye tracking, and environmental scans—to facilitate interactive experiences. This data collection raises significant security and privacy concerns. In this presentation, I will begin by outlining the threat model inherent in XR environments and highlight the privacy issues identified in recent academic research. I will discuss my recent work on XR privacy, such as deducing the 360-degree videos users are viewing based on their head movement trajectories and examining privacy policy compliance issues in XR applications from major platforms. I will conclude by exploring additional potential threats within XR systems and the future intersection of XR and generative AI.

<h3>The Impact of AI/ML on XR Security</h3>

<p>The boundaries between the physical and digital (virtual) worlds are
rapidly dissolving. Users are increasingly dependent on computing
devices, such as extended reality (XR) systems, to engage with
physical environments and one another. These devices, in turn, are
becoming heavily reliant on AI/ML to enable and enhance such
interactions. However, the rapid development, accessibility and
adoption of AI/ML have also intensified the complexity and uncertainty
of the security landscape, particularly in the dynamic between
attackers and defenders. In this talk, I will present some of our
recent work exploring how AI/ML is shaping security and privacy
challenges within XR systems.</p>

    <!-- Dissemination Plan -->
    <!-- <h2 style="color:#4682B4;">Dissemination Plan</h2> 
    <p>We will promote the workshop through various channels, including ComSoc listservs (e.g., tccc-announce, tccn, spcc, cistc), the ACM SIGMOBILE email list, the email 
        list of CIPHER (Newsletter of Security &amp; Privacy TC) and the PETs Symposium, and the conference website. Additionally, we will advertise the workshop to the 
        DARPA ICS program's contributors, to the recipients of Meta Research Awards in Trustworthy AR and VR, to the organizers and participants of recently held related 
        workshops and other XR Systems community events, such as the NSF Workshop on Networking and Systems Challenges in Immersive Computing and the UIUC Immerse Symposium, 
        and to major XR industries (e.g., Meta) through our alumni (e.g., Dr. Bin Li's student will join Meta Reality Lab in May 2025). To enhance visibility, we will create 
        an online presence for the workshop, including a dedicated website and social media accounts. At least two organizers will be physically present during the event to 
        ensure smooth execution. Dr. Bin Li served as a publicity chair for ACM MobiHoc 2020 and 2022. Dr. Ming Li served as a publicity chair for IEEE CNS 2025, with the 
        conference focusing on communications and network security. Thus, we have a rich experience in promoting conferences and workshops. </p> -->
